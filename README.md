# Guilty Gear Web Scraper

November 13, 2022.

Update goals:
- [x] Be up to date with Dustloop pages
- [x] Include more data to characters
- [x] Include Xrd Rev 2, and Accent Core Plus R
- [x] Output three scripts for each game instead of scripts for each character (less of a pain)
- [x] Provide sql scripts to initialize tables
- [x] Provide the output scripts (so Dustloop doesn't have to have excess traffic)

Web-scraper to pull Guilty Gear frame data from the Dustloop Website for a PostgreSQL database (https://dustloop.com/wiki/index.php).

Initially based off of Ania Kubow's nodejs webscraper (https://github.com/kubowania/nodejs-webscraper).

The web scraper data is being used for a Web API I am working on (https://github.com/chris-dykes-j/Guilty-Gear-API).
