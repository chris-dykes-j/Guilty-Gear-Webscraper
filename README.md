#Scrape to SQL

Web-scraper to pull Guilty Gear Strive frame data from Dustloop Website (https://dustloop.com/wiki/index.php) for a PostgreSQL database. Initially based off of Ania Kubow's nodejs webscraper (https://github.com/kubowania/nodejs-webscraper), I made significant alterations to retrieve data desired. The data will be used for a larger Guilty Gear project.

The scraper could be used for other games on Dustloop, but alterations would need to be made.
